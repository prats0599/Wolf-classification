# Wolves-classification
Dataset created via google Images.   
Used a resnet34 model pretrained on the imagenet dataset to classify different breeds of wolves. Trained it further on a self-created dataset & used data augmentation and progressive resizing.    
Cleaned noisy/mislabelled data to improve model accuracy and get sota results(96%).  
Part of fastai's lesson2 homework.
